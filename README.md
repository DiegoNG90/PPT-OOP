Paper Rock Scissors - Object Orientated Programming

In 2020, while I was learning Python, I made a Paper Rock Scissors programme in functional programming fashioned way. Also, it was a Code-along session, so today I tried to:
 
-Challenge myself and try to do it all over by my own, without any outsorce help
-Using classes and making an OOP programming instead of Functional programming.
-Make it with pure and Vainilla JS instead of Python.
-I didn't have to google nothing: everything was by myself and therefore, probably some repetitive code, or maybe NOT THE BEST composition or inheritance.
-Yet, since it was a challenge, I'm very happy to take it and make it work.
